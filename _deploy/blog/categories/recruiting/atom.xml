    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="http://www.julep.com/">Julep</a> was invited to the University of Washington to present to the
Computer Science students on life in a startup.  We were impressed with the
number of students present and the lively conversation which ensued.  While
Julep has been around as a Nail Parlor for some time, the e-commerce solution
will celebrate only it's 2nd birthday this coming summer.</p>

<p>More intriguing, beginning with myself, the entire engineering team has a
tenure of just over six months.  In a very short time we've written a lot of
code and evanglized the merits of Lean Agile developement.  In a follow up
post, I'll talk more about our software development process.  We hail from 3
distinct geographies: Seattle, Michigan and Ukraine.</p>
