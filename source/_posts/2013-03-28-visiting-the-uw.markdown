Recently [Julep](http://www.julep.com/) was invited to the University of Washington to present to the 
Computer Science students on life in a startup.  We were impressed with the
number of students present and the lively conversation which ensued.  While 
Julep has been around as a Nail Parlor for some time, the e-commerce solution 
will celebrate only it's 2nd birthday this coming summer.

More intriguing, beginning with myself, the entire engineering team has a 
tenure of just over six months.  In a very short time we've written a lot of 
code and evanglized the merits of Lean Agile developement.  In a follow up 
post, I'll talk more about our software development process.  We hail from 3 
distinct geographies: Seattle, Michigan and Ukraine.  

Without further ado, here is the presentation Jason Baik and I delivered:
