We started doing brown bag lunch and presentations recently. The lunch was
Po' Boys from [Where ya at matt](http://whereyaatmatt.com/), and the topic
was JavaScript MV*.

MVC ([Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) 
is a pattern used to keep code organized by dividing it into components.
Recently this structure has been migrating from the back-end to the front-end. 
Anything that keeps us more organized and standardized is probably a good idea, so we 
decided to look into it more.

### tl;dr
+ **BackboneJS** - Easy to use, well documented, tons of tuts. You could/should be using it
right now
+ **AngularJS** - MV* of the future. Use it for contained projects, where we want to feel like we are in the future
+ **EmberJS** - Structured, opinionated, but overshadowed by the other two

### The presentation
The presentation notes have all of my talking points, so be sure to
